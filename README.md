# Get-To-Watch
This is a movie-recommendation web-app. React.js is used for the same.
The recommendation algorithm is simple and is implemented using pure javascript. I found Euclidean distance between each user and found 5 users which rate the movies most closely like the current user and based on the data of that users I found  weighted average and ultimately estimated rating  for all unwatched movie of current user and shown the top movies.
